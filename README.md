### Content Maintainer Expectations

1. Review and merge new PRs to their section of the curriculum
2. Keep curriculum content "up to date" - including linking to new content when its source of truth moves to new locations (ex, if curriculum content is moved to a new source of truth, link to the new source of truth within the curriculum (and remove the duplicated content)
3. Review their curriculum section at least 1x/quarter to check for needed updates / deprecation / etc

## Launchpad Homepage

The Launchpad homepage is now a single html file, which is also hosted by Hugo
and tracked in this repository at: `layouts/index.html`.

CSS for the homepage is mostly managed through tailwindcss, which gets installed
automatically with npm. Tailwindcss runs as a standalone application, monitoring
the source code, and generating only the css that will be needed. The command to
run the tailwindcss daemon from the root directory is:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```
npx tailwindcss -i ./static/css/tailwind-input.css -o ./static/css/tailwind-output.css --minify --watch
```
