Protocol Labs enables a network of projects, tools, startups, research, and communities to spring up and evolve around new protocols and web3 technologies. As the web3 ecosystem grows, the project tools, startups, research, and communities help create a growing and robust network that helps benefit and incentivize the ongoing evolution of web3 technologies.

The Protocol Labs' mission is to develop technology to drive humanity forward. This mission is inclusive of all people. As a company, we‚Äôve determined that Labbers are our most important resource in driving humanity forward. Labbers Resource Groups (LRG) are one way we can foster awareness and inclusion in the Protocol Labs Network and drive Protocol Labs forward as an organization. LRGs can also be a powerful tool for

* Building an inclusive culture in the Protocol Labs Network.
* Encouraging different perspectives
* Driving business initiatives forward
* Offering feedback on programs
* Providing leadership opportunities
* Offering mentorship and networking opportunities
* Building social connection
* Professional development

**Our Background: The Challenges of Our Time**

The advent of computing radically transformed humanity, and so has the flourishing of our global nervous system: the Internet. This still-nascent medium of communication, of digital existence, will connect and empower us in ways we‚Äôve only begun to understand. In just a few short decades, we‚Äôve acquired tremendous, almost magical superpowers: we can speak to half the planet, at any time and from almost anywhere; we can explore and search a complete compendium of human knowledge in seconds; we can reason about and solve tremendously difficult problems; we can work, play, and be together at a distance; we can conjure systems of digital and mechanical agents to do our bidding; we can change the world, we can save lives, we can wield all the powers of our species, for good and bad, with a sequence of keystrokes.

Long term, universal computation will transform us more than language has, which is indeed saying something. But it is important to realize we will see radical changes in the short term, too: computing and the internet will grant us even greater superpowers, as we fuse ever tighter with our technology.
The horizon of computing is exciting and turbulent. We face optimistic progress, significant challenges, and existential threats. We navigate this complex landscape by grounding ourselves in two important goals. I will speak more about these in future communications. (For a longer treatment of this background, [see this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jONZtXMu03w&t=554s).

### Understand the Culture of Asynchronous Work and its Processes

Teams are the reporting organization structure established by Protocol Labs. Though they establish Labbers‚Äô general focus of work, the nature of PL‚Äôs collaborative organization means that Labbers may work with many individuals outside their team and that outside of Protocol Labs.
At Protocol Labs, to enable contributions and collaborations worldwide, we follow principles around working asynchronously.
The benefits of asynchronous communication, though this approach might seem non-traditional for some, are numerous:
* üë©‚ÄçüíªThe ability to build large stretches of uninterrupted focus time.
* üåèThe ability to communicate with a remote team, with members in multiple time zones.
* üìëHaving a record of the communication shared that can be referred to later on. Whereas synchronous communication often requires taking notes (creating) while hearing the message (consuming).
* ü§îThe chance to digest and think about a response before responding. (We all know immediate responses are often not your best.)
* üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èThe freedom to not have to be always ‚Äúat your desk‚Äù in case someone wants to talk to you.
This style benefits your teammates as well. Requesting someone‚Äôs time to find a document or pinging someone for something non-urgent are two of the most common productivity killers for deep-focus work. As you might be aware, there is a famous meme on how you should ‚Äúnever interrupt a programmer.‚Äù Once you read it, you will quickly realize that this applies to all sorts of work.

In our mission to drive breakthroughs in computing to push humanity forward, we welcome and listen to every voice. Humanity, after all, is composed of all humans, and learning from each other is key.
To ensure these conversations remain constructive and safe for all, we have developed guidelines for participation:
* We are kind and respectful. We do not insult or disparage. And we ask questions, seek clarification, and assume we don‚Äôt know the full story. We communicate in good faith, meaning that we don‚Äôt provoke people intentionally. We help one another grow and assume that we have the best intent.
* We are allies. We stand up for one another. We build the culture and environment we want to see. So, when we see something, we say something.

**More on How to Interact**

Discord, Email, and Zoom are our workplace: in interacting with other Labbers, remember that they are your collaborators and peers.
* Written communication lacks important cues we typically get when speaking to others in person.
* Written communication is long-lasting: remember that written communication lasts longer than verbal communication, so others will return to it repeatedly.
* Mind the audience: in communicating with others, pause and think about who your message is intended for and whether the medium is appropriate.

To ensure these conversations remain constructive and safe for all, we have developed guidelines for participation:

* We are kind and respectful. We do not insult, or disparage. And we ask questions, seek clarification, and assume we don't know the full story. We communicate in good faith, meaning that we don‚Äôt provoke people intentionally. We help one another grow and assume that we have the best intent.

### Understand the Philosophy of the Protocol Lab Network and What it Means to be a Decentralized Entity
**Principles**

* We should improve the internet and computing generally. Secure and robust access to information, communication, and computing has become a critical part of what it means to be a modern human. The internet has become the main vehicle for human interactions worldwide, and it will only become more so as our devices and interfaces improve. Brain-machine interfaces will cement this, and those are not so far away. Therefore, [fixing problems with the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RCwZDRwk48&t=568s) and upgrading our computational fabric will have a tremendous impact on humanity, now and in the future. **This is the Why.**

* We should accelerate the ideas-to-superpowers pipeline. At the heart of computing progress lies a simple process: the research, development, and deployment cycle. Ideas are conceived and refined, encoded into mathematical rules, programmed into software, and deployed into computers, which grants superpowers to humans worldwide. The better and faster we are at sifting ideas through this pipeline, the better and faster our superpowers will come. **This is the How.**

Breakthroughs from labs that are exclusively or mostly focused on research tend to stay buried as papers. Sometimes the lag is natural, the research is far ahead of its broad applicability. But we find hundreds of breakthroughs useful long before they reach users. It can take many years, even decades, before breakthroughs are realized in products that improve people‚Äôs lives. This is massively inefficient! Research has to be coupled closely with development and deployment so that we can iterate through the cycle quickly, and build good products that solve problems for people.
