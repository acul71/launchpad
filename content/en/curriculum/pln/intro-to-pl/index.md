## Describe the History of Protocol Labs and its Evolution

Protocol Labs was founded in 2014 by Juan Benet, the inventor of IPFS and Filecoin. Protocol Labs released IPFS to the world in January 2015.

By 2016, IPFS became one of the most used and relied-on technologies in the Blockchain industry, hailed by the community as the “Future of the Web.” In that same year, 2016, Protocol Labs also created libp2p, IPLD, multi formats, and many other projects.

Protocol Labs enables a network of projects, tools, startups, research, communities (and more) to spring up and evolve around new protocols and web3 technologies. As this ecosystem grows, these projects invest in the network itself, and the network grows along with it, which in turn benefits and incentivizes this ongoing evolution.

Protocol Labs, at its core, consists of an organization (also referred to internally as Starfleet) that supports open source software projects, engineering research in multiple fields related to computation, communication, and knowledge, as well as other services for a network of organizations that builds upon and expands the capabilities of the core technologies.

Protocol Labs is building the next generation of the internet. We are an open-source Network that spans the research-to-development pipeline to create new protocols, tools, and services to improve the internet radically. Our products serve thousands of organizations and millions of people.

Many teams in the PL Network are fully distributed and follow a common set of open-source practices to grow and flourish together. This distributed, open-source philosophy is at the core of how we operate.
We also believe in connecting and bringing people together to inspire innovation. That’s why we have yearly PL Network “Lab Weeks” to gather our community of “labbers” (contributors and members of PL Network teams) together and align on the next year’s opportunities and challenges.

### The Protocol Labs Network in Q1 2022 | Molly Mackinlay

In this talk by Molly Mackinlay, understand where Protocol Labs is an organization in 2022, where we are headed, the trajectory, evolving landscape, and how we are accelerating the PL network. Originally given in February 2022.

## Understand what the Protocol Labs Network (PLN) is

Protocol Labs is a constantly evolving network of 450+ projects, companies, and organizations. Understanding the landscape of organizations, projects, and teams can be complex. This section presents tools to help you understand and navigate these systems and organizations.
Protocol Labs Portal
This portal is the central point of reference for all the resources available to PLN members. The portal includes information about Network Services from Mosaia, the network directory, and communication channels.

### Identify the different teams/groups of PL and PLN that help move the organization into the future

Protocol Labs' mission can be visualized and organized in the structure of its main categories:

* Starfleet
* Outercore
* Network Goods
* Member Services
* PL Corp

These groups collectively function to support Protocol Labs and its mission through its various but specific roles. To find out more, click on the respective link for each group.

#### Starfleet

This group is…

#### Outercore

The goal of Outercore is to develop tools, improve systems, conduct research, and share its OSS, processes, and ideas with the Protocol Labs Network.

#### Network Goods

The goal of Network Goods is to pursue open, collaborative, high-impact research that pushes the boundaries of what computing can do for humanity.

#### Member Services

The goal of Member Services

#### PL Corp

This group is…

### The Future of Web3

At the end of 2022, Protocol Labs consist of 450+ companies and projects building in our network. As the web3 space accelerates, now is a great time for high-growth researchers & developers inside and outside web3 to ramp up their “InterPlanetary” knowledge and contribute to these cutting-edge technologies.

From core OSS contribution to Radius grants distributed systems engineers, to network researchers, to community managers, to startup operators, there are a vast number of exciting opportunities across PLN teams and companies.
