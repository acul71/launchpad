# PLN 1.11: Understand the history of Protocol Labs (PL) and its evolution.

## Describe the History of Protocol Labs and its Evolution

Protocol Labs was founded in 2014 by Juan Benet, the inventor of IPFS and Filecoin. Protocol Labs released IPFS to the world in January 2015.

By 2016, IPFS became one of the most used and relied-on technologies in the Blockchain industry, hailed by the community as the “Future of the Web.” In addition, Protocol Labs also created libp2p, IPLD, multi formats, and many other projects.

Protocol Labs enables a network of projects, tools, startups, research, communities (and more) to spring up and evolve around new protocols and web3 technologies. As this ecosystem grows, these projects invest in the network itself, and the network grows along with it, which in turn benefits and incentivizes this ongoing evolution.

Protocol Labs, at its core, is an organization (also referred to internally as Starfleet) that supports open-source software projects, engineering research in multiple fields related to computation, communication, and knowledge, as well as other services. PL also supports the network of organizations that builds upon and expands the capabilities of its core technologies.

Protocol Labs is building the next generation of the internet. We are an open-source network that spans the research-to-development pipeline to create new protocols, tools, and services to improve the internet radically. Our products serve thousands of organizations and millions of people.

Many [teams in the PL Network](https://www.plnetwork.io/directory/teams)  are fully distributed and follow a standard set of open-source practices to grow and flourish together. This distributed, open-source philosophy is at the core of how PL operates.

We also believe in connecting and bringing people together to inspire innovation. That’s why we have yearly PL Network “Lab Weeks” to gather our community of “labbers” (contributors and members of PL Network teams) together and align on the following year’s opportunities and challenges.

A part of PL’s evolution is its ability to have smaller groups within, go through nucleation (think of it as an internal incubator) and become its team and company. Aligned with the philosophy of Bell Labs, PL is very much about supporting numerous groups with research.

# PLN 1.12 - Understand what consists within the  Protocol Labs Network (PLN).

Protocol Labs is a constantly evolving network of 450+ projects, companies, and organizations. Understanding the landscape of organizations, projects, and teams can be complex. This section presents tools to help you understand and navigate these systems and organizations.

Protocol Labs Portal

This portal is the central point of reference for all the resources available to PLN members. The portal includes information about Network Services from Mosaia, the network directory, and communication channels.

## Identify the different teams/groups of PL and PLN that help move the organization into the future

The Protocol Labs Team has a handful of teams that support PL as a whole. Under PL are the following teams:

* Starfleet
* Ecosystem (Outercore)
* Network Goods
* Spaceport (Member Services)
* PL Corp

Information about each group will be detailed in PLN 1.13.

In addition to the primary teams for PL, we have a wide range of network partners that build on top of the protocols used within PL. As more teams are developed and expanded, a need for Working Groups was created to help with cross-department and company collaboration.

## The process of a Working Group is as follows

Once a Project or Enablement team starts coordinating a certain number of Labbers (> five people or so), it may start to organize itself into Working Groups (WGs). Working Groups are smaller Labbers (3-5 is ideal) with a specific mandate—focusing on a project, the development, and maintenance of a protocol, a particular set of users, etc.

## Working Groups, Teams, and Organizations

Each Working Group has a Captain who is a champion for the project, product, and/or focus area. Working Group Captains take the lead on writing or guiding the project specs, documentation, and other artifacts to support the Working Group. The Captain also facilitates [planning](https://protocol-labs.gitbook.io/protocol-labs/general/how-we-work/planning) and guides the group to make solid and collaborative decisions.

Each Working Group can experiment with setting its own pace, tracking work, and defining priorities. Working Groups should expose their focus through Objectives & Key Results (OKRs) to the rest of the organization (creating a “common interface” by which we can understand goals across the org), assign a Captain, create an entry point repo, and generally have at least two full-time contributors dedicated to the WG.

Contributors generally shouldn’t carry responsibilities across multiple working groups. This is not forbidden by any means, but it is usually discouraged as it could prevent the contributor from having the necessary focus.

Here is a [list of WGs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CiVUOicvY6V2NFZOEnJU0UHXPTAv2v3o_nh_nqSF01A/edit?usp=sharing) at Protocol Labs.

## Other Structures for Coordination within Projects and Teams: Research Groups and Tiger Teams

Some Projects and Enablement Teams are experimenting with other ways of coordinating work, including Research Groups and Tiger Teams. IPFS, for example, has deployed both and has shared a [great explanation](https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt/blob/master/TEAMS_ROLES_STRUCTURES.md#expanded-description) of these coordination strategies and their benefits.

A Research Group is generally formed to explore a discrete research topic and is supported by the Protocol Labs Research Team. Members of Research Groups are encouraged to participate in multiple research groups. Tiger teams are small, temporary groups of people usually formed to solve a specific problem or build a complex feature. They frequently include when significant iteration/collaboration is required to achieve success. Once the objective is reached, the tiger team dissolves into their standard working groups.
